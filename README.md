Random bits of programming I've done for fun.  

* `rsk`: implementation of Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm for 
converting permutations to tableaux.
* `day_piechart.ipynb`: I honestly do not remember writing this, but it 
seems to break down my day in pie chart format?
* `avg_location.ipynb`: based on a question once posed by @gvwilson, 
calculates average location over time (based on lat/long)
* `roman_numerals.ipynb`: converts roman numerals to actual numerals.
